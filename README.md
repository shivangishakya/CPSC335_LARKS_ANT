Project Instructions:
The Larks Ant
So far, the Langton and TP ants need to maintain no internal state – the data needed to decide on an action is in each cell.
We extend the ant to a “Larks” ant by adding a mode whereby the Larks ant will sometimes ignore the color
changes but instead continue in a straight line for sequence of cell moves; which requires maintaining some
state, a countdown. (Larks, or LRCS, means Left-Right-Countdown-Straight.) This works as follows. '
-First, as usual our K-color sequence is indexed color[0]..color[K-1].
-Second, each color (equivalently, each color index) can map to one of 3 actions: Turn Left, Turn Right, and
Straight-Countdown.
-Third, the bot FSM is in one of 3 states/modes: Normal or Straight or Countdown mode.
Here is the Larks ant brain FSM processing in detail:
 1. Read the cell's color, translate to its color sequence index.
 2. Obtain the action given the color index
 If FSM is in Normal mode and an L/R action then
  3a. Store index in the FSM counter // Just in case the next cell wants us to go Straight
  3b. Change nose direction accordingly
 Else If FSM is in Normal mode and a Countdown-Straight action then
  3. Change to Countdown mode & don't change direction
 Else if FSM is in Countdown Mode then // we'll go straight, no change in direction
  3a. If FSM counter is non-positive, then change FSM to Normal Mode
  3b. Decrement the FSM counter & don't change direction
 4. Increment cell's color modulo the number of colors // ie, with wraparound
 5. Move to neighbor cell // in nose direction

So, the Larks ant is a bit more complex than the TP ant. Sometimes it decides to go straight based on the cell
color index (for a count indicated by the previous cell it had been in), and while it goes straight it doesn't try to
turn until it's finished counting down to zero.
Because we'll be running the Larks ant on a finite grid (rectangle) in a browser webpage, we will have the ant
wrap around to the opposite cell if it tries to “step off” an edge of the grid.
The colors will be black, blue, yellow, and red, in that order, with color indexes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
The actions will be Turn Left, Turn Right, and Straight-Countdown, with action indexes 0, 1, and 2.
The color-action map will be 0 → 0, 1 → 1, 2 → 2, 3 → 1. So the action order is 0121.
The Larks #0121 ant will start in an all black 60 by 40 grid (with each grid cell being 10 by 10 pixels) at cell
location (30,20) (row,col), and the ant's nose will be facing up (north) toward the cell (0,20) at the top-edge of
column 20.
